	<h2 id="purpose"> What is the purpose of the website?</h2>
		<p>

		This website would be a good platform for me to express my work that I have collected over the years and would help increase my online presence. It is a great tool for me to keep a record of all my work and refer to them conveniently instead of loosing them over time. Because an online portfolio speaks much more about me than just my resume, I feel that it would also help me show my work and personality while I apply for jobs and internships to employers. And it may also be a good source of inspiration and ideas for other designers and their projects.

	<h2 id="audience">Who is the intended audience?
</h2>	
	    <p>
	   My portfolio is intended both towards potential employers in the design industry who would want to go through my work instead of having me submit an actual, physical portfolio or mailing them my work. It may even help peers who would want to refer to my website for any ideas or inspirations since my online portfolio would display my work.  </p>

	<h2 id="tone">What tone do you want for the site’s written content?</h2>
		<p>
Since my intended audience is both employers and peers, I think I could have a semi-formal and a conversational tone. I feel that that kind of a tone would define my character due to the way I speak, giving the user an insight not only to my work, but also to my language and voice and hence, helping the user to understand my personality better. Having said that, I would also like to keep the text on my website to minimal except for the text that comes under 'About' section where I would have to explain myself. The reason being that I don't want much of lanuguage to over-shadow my work unless it becomes necesarry to explain some of the works on the website.

	<h2 id="primary-content">What will be the primary content of your site?</h2>
		<p>
The primary content of my website would be divided into three sections from the landing page: Work, Contact and About. I would prefer to keep my pages minimalistic and simple. Each of these section would then lead to their relative pages. The reason that I want to keep my primary content to only three sections is because I want to keep it easy for the user to go back and forth only through three sections and not make it too complex or crowded.

	<h2 id="secondary-content">What will be the secondary content?</h2>
		<p>
            The secondary content will be the pages that will be redirected from Work, About and Contact.
Works: Would display my work in a portfolio format for people to see. Once clicnked, ursers can also go back and forth to see the individual work once clicked in a slide show format as well. 
About: A description about me and what I do and what I did previously. This includes my education and my mission in the design industry, how my work resonates with my past experience and what I would like to pursue and accomplish in the future.
            Contact: Would provide my email address for people to contact me. </p>

	<h2 id="navigate">How will users navigate through your site?</h2>
		<p>
The navigation of my website is pretty consistent throughout. All the three sections, Work, Contact & About are accessible to each other on the bottom left of the page, while the path to the home page is on the top left. The web site navigation is built on a consistent grid line, but also making sure that the content is varying, hence not confusing the user and creating discretion between pages. The site is again minimalistic, hence, not confusing the user with way too many options to chose from and getting them to loose their navigation.
